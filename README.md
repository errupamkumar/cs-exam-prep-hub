# CS Exam Prep Hub

An interactive web-based hub to practice computer science exam questions, track your score, and quickly revise key concepts.  

This project is built as a lightweight, front-end-only quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with questions stored in a JSON file for easy updates.

- Interactive quiz interface built with `index.html` and styled via `style.css`
- Score calculation and feedback handled in `script.js`
- Simple structure so anyone can add or modify questions without touching core logic.
